As a first time player of `Underdark`, welcome!

This is just a few things to note for first time players.

1 - Check key configuration on the main game screen before you start
    and note your movement keys (probably by default, arrow keys).

    The game will tell you on the main screen and the configuration screen
    if you have unconfigured keys.

2 - Your `t`argetting key is for bows + wands. Target then `f`ire away!
    You can only target monsters in your field of vision! Pressing `t`
    multiple times will cycle through visible targets.

3 - When you load in, you get a random player, you might want to
    check your `i`nventory, and see what your starting with!

4 - The `i`nventory screen is a bit of a catch-all, you can check your
    stats, as well as level up (if possible) etc from this screen

5 - `l`oadout toggle only swaps your two weapon hands, so you can equip
    a bow and swap to a sword etc. It does an un-equip/equip so if you
    have cursed items... your loadout is not going to swap correctly!

6 - New players should look to start with Barbarian, that will give you the
    easiest time.

7 - Try and explore all of level 1 to find the best weapons and armour you can,
    as level 1 is the tutorial level.  Once you get to level 2, it starts
    to get nasty with enemy spell casters and ranged enemies!

8 - Centipedes are the most dangerous enemy on level 1, they can poison you so
    be careful how you approach them... (and poison wears off after a long
    period of time)

Have Fun
